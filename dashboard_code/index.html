These portfolio managers select a combination of compannies to invest in with a goal to have better returns than ETF's and index's, as well as tailor these picks around the investors profile.  These benefit comes with a large minimum deposit and a certain holding period of clients money.  Mutual Funds spend a lot of money on analyst, economic and industry research, as well as CEO meetings.  These are some reasons that make Mutual Funds very lucrative.</p>
                        <h2>Difference Between Growth, Value, and Blend Strategies</h2>
