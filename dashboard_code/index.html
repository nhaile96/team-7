They are a basket of securities or companies in a certain sector or with certain criteria that allows investors lower risk with more reward over time.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Mutual Funds are business's that manage clients money for the individual investor.  These portfolio managers select a combination of compannies to invest in with a goal to have better returns than ETF's and index's, as well as tailor these picks around the investors profile.  These benefit comes with a large minimum deposit and a certain holding period of clients money.  Mutual Funds spend a lot of money on analyst, economic and industry research, as well as CEO meetings.  These are some reasons that make Mutual Funds very lucrative.</p>
                        <h2>Difference Between Growth, Value, and Blend Strategies</h2>
